STATUS: NOT READY

# Welcome to Rose-odot! 
Rose-odot is a template project file aimed at mimicing some systems from the Source Engine, all without the need for your end-user to have the source project file! They'll be able to make materials, maps, map logic, etc. from simple text files and a (soon to be) map editor!

## Can I use Rose-odot?
Yes! HOWEVER, check the usibility status above; if it says "NOT READY", then it is recommended to not use the system yet. As of April 14th 2024, this system is still under heavy WIP. 

## Where is the map editor?
As of April 14th, 2024, it does not exist. Currently, core features within Godot are being worked on, and a map editor will begin being made in the future. When work on it begins, a new branch called "map_editor" will be created.
