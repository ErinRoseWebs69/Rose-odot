# Rose-odot
## What is *Rose-odot*?
*Rose-odot* is basically a template Godot project file that will allow users to make maps in Blender, including entities and such, and load them into Godot. Entities will automatically be given a script that dictates how the entity will function.

## Will *Rose-odot* be updated to newer versions of Godot?
Yes, but only when stables releases of the newest Godot versions are released. 

## Is *Rose-odot* open to changes from other people?
***Yes***. Any ways to optimize and improve this system is whole-heartedly welcomed, as I (Rosemary) may not be fully aware of other functions or systems that could be better than what I'm currently doing.

### Is *Rose-odot* a play on words of the food?
Accidentally...
